# Autonomous Navigation

Using the saved map (e.g. `dia.yaml` and `dia.pgm`), it is now possible to achieve autonomous navigation i.e. the robot can compute a global trajectory to a target point and then autonomously navigate to through this trajectory while avoiding obstacles locally. 

{% hint style="success" %}
Write a new launch file named `navigation.launch` that achieve this.
Goals can be sent through rviz by clicking on a specific location on the loaded map.
{% endhint %}

This launch file should launch the following nodes:
- MapServer (http://wiki.ros.org/map_server) using the 2 files generated by GMapping.  
- AMCL (http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) to localize the robot on the map using the laser scans and Monte Carlo method
- Move Base (http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) or another node to make the robot move based on target positions

	```xml
	<launch>
	  <!-- Bringup the robot -->
	  ...
	  
	  <!-- Laser /scan-->
	  ...
	  
	  <!-- Run the map server -->
	  <node name="map_server" pkg="map_server" type="map_server" args="$(find larm1_slam)/maps/dia.yaml" />
	  
	  <!-- Localization using AMCL -->
	  ...
	  
	  <!-- Navigation using MoveBase -->
	  ...
		  
	</launch>
	```

# Final exercice (your project)

As a final exercice, you should:

1. Use a real turtlebot with a laser
2. Create a map of a maze in the robotics room 
3. Make the robot autonomously navigate into the maze using goals sent via `rviz`
