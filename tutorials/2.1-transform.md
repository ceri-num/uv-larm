# Move Forward

The idea here is to develop a move strategy to permits a robot to reach positions successively, in a cluttered environment.
To do that, the node subscribes to a topic `goals` to get position to reach 

This tutorial supposes that you perform the tutorial "[Move the Robot](1.2-move.md)". A correction is proposed on [tbot package](https://bitbucket.org/imt-mobisyst/mb6-tbot/src/master/tbot_pytools/tbot_pytools/reactive_move.py).

The main difficulty here consists in following positioning kwoledge of the goals while the robot is moving.

## Record a goal position


## Manage a list of goal positions


## Permit autonomous navigation

## Clean node

record goal in global frame (`odom`), whatever the initial reference frame.

Make global frame parametrable (default `map`)
