# Introduction to image processing.

Vision provides a rich information about the immediate environment around the robot.
However it requires to process the images to extract pertinent information...

The goal here is to detect a specific object in the scene. The first proposed approach is to detect the object regarding its main color before to move toward approaches handle textures.

## Setup our programming environment

This tutorial focus on `OpenCV` librairy, addressed in `Python` development language on a *Linux* machine.

First we want to install Python3 and the libraries:  Numpy, Matplot, Sklearn, Scipy and OpenCV.

The command `whereis` permit to localize a command (like `python3` interpreter). If python3 is correctly installed, its execution would not be empty:

```bash
whereis python3
```

Python uses its own package managers `pip` to install libraries. So just to be sure you can:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 pip
```

Then we can use pip to install modules:

```bash
pip3 install numpy tensorflow opencv-python opencv-contrib-python sklearn scipy matplotlib psutil scikit-image
```

Now normally you can load the different modules, for instance:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from scipy.cluster.vq import *
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn import preprocessing
```
