## Model Predictive Control (MPC) supervision

MPC technique is a tool of automatic Science to compute an optimal control.
However, it does not handle long horizon nor uncertainty.
The idea here is to develop an MPC-control ros node that could be supervised.

## Multi-robot path planning

The difficulty in Multi-robot path planning is to find several paths that permits the robot to reach their goal position by avoiding any collision.

## Apply Q-Learning on Robot

Q-Learning is a simple but powerful tool permitting an artificial agent to learn autonomously how to act.
The goal of this project is to apply this algorithm to mobile robots.
