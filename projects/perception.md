# Perceive and Modeling

## Perceive Interactive scene

Interactive scenario supposes to perceive the object and the human around.
Based on a RealSense sensor, we wan to develop a node identifying the element in the scene and by taking a special focus on humans.
Based on this new capability, the goal is to propose interactive scenario (drive, follow...)

## Human in the Loop

In interactive scenario, the robot behavior must be adapted to the presence and the action of the human in the environment.
Ideally, the robot is capable of interpreting the human behavior to anticipate its actions.
Based on such capability, the robot would modify its trajectory toward it goals in a less invasive way.

## Vectorial Navigation

SLAM architectures are mostly based on gridMap. 
With a vectorial representation of the environment,
it would be possible to manipulate a graph of geometrical objects to compute paths.
We suppose that a Vectorial Based SLAM and Navigation would permit saving computing resources without important lost on the precision.
Let verify it.
