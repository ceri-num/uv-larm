# Projects

It is possible to continue working on the notions presented in the UV-Larm, with a one-month project.
Each project proposes to a group of 2 studies to handle a subject in a autonomous way.

The project is organized on several topics: 

- **Differentâ€™s Robots**: handle a specific robot, areal or maritime drone (in real and/or in the simulation)
- **Decision Making**: Try optimizing robot(s) behavior.
- **Percive and Model**: target the capability of a robot to build knowledge about it environment (and notably by using vision).
