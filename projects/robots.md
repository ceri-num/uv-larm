# Differentâ€™s Robots

## Robust Tbot

Turtlebot2 works well now in _ROS2_.
The goal of the project is to embed the driver and the minimal control architecture on a RasberryPi computer card on the robot.
The configuration must consider that here are potentially multiple robots.

(Manage doamin Id, setup calibration processes)

**Potential Supervision**: Guillaume Lozenguez, Luc Fabresse, Noury Bourraqadi

## Wake-up Freight Robot

Freight is a mobile base initially working on _ROS1_.
The challenge consists in making the robot working again
and in migrate the control to _ROS2_

**Potential Supervision**: Guillaume Lozenguez, Luc Fabresse

## Autonomous Boat

Simulate a aquatic surface robot on _ROS2_ in inland navigation scenario.
Suppose to simulate an environement with water and the specificities of the robots inside of it. 

**Potential Supervision**: Luc Fabresse, Noury Bourraqadi, Guillaume Lozenguez

## Aerial drone

Deploy control and suppervision architecture on small drone or in simulation.

**Potential Supervision**: Sebastien Ambelouis, Luc Fabresse, Noury Bourraqadi
