# LARM - Logiciel et Architecture pour la Robotique Mobile - Software and Architecture for Mobile-Robotics

A lecture on software and architecture for mobile robots at the [IMT-Nord](http://www.imt-nord-europe.fr) engineering school.

In this course we propose an introduction on how to develop a modular control and supervision software for a mobile platform.
The notions are illustrated with tutorials based on Linux/[ROS](https://ros.org/) and [Kobuki/Turtlebot2](http://kobuki.yujinrobot.com/) robot.

## This support

This support is stored on [github](https://github.com) shared thanks to [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com).

## Tutorials

Due to the pandemic extraordinary situation, this course is largely based over [TheConstruct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/) solution.
TheConstruct provides courses materials and more importantly virtualized ROS machine allowing you to develop robotics software based on Gazebo simulation.

<!--
This lecture is composed of multiple guided tutorials (non-exhaustive list):

* Setting up your own ROS environment
* Moving a robot
* Simulatenous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
* Autonomous Navigation
* Robotics Vision
-->

## Challenge

The evaluation mainly realizes on an application through a specific challenge:

- Control an **AGV**
- Mapping and Localization
- Research and recognition of an object

## Going further

Most of the content and supports for learning robotics architecture are already shared on the internet.
We try to orient the students through project realizations rather than to provide an exhaustive definition of concepts and implementations.
This course relies on the [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) middleware for practical sessions, the ROS wiki tutorials and ros-packages' descriptions: <https://wiki.ros.org/>.

You also can find an excellent virtual working environment and resources on [TheConstruct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/).
