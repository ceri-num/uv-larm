# Challenge Kick-Off


The challenge aims to put learners in the development of a micro robotic project.
In the end, both the execution of the proposed solution and the source code with documentation would be evaluated.

The main objectives of the project consist of:

- Control a robot in a cluttered environment
- Map a static environment
- Detect all the **Nuka-Cola**
- Estimate the position of the **Nuka-Cola** in the map
- Optimaze the exploration strategy

## Agile software development

Agile software development aims to break with traditional project management by preferring:

- **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to Change** over following a plan

The main feature of Agile Software Development consists of iterative development by moving forward incrementally
and by delivering operational versions frequently.

## Create a group

As a first move you have to constitute a group of 2 or 3 developers.

- Log on the proposed (virtual tutorial room on discord)[https://discord.gg/MWvznHgWnf]
- Squat one of the Group-XX areas with your teammate(s).
- Use this area to share your information about your work (and potentially your screen, in the visual channel).
