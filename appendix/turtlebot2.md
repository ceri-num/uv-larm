# Simulate a turtlebot2

The first step in the challenge is to get control over a turtlebot2 robot equipped with a standard plan laser.

## Robot configuration

Turtlebot is a simple robot very similar than small home-cleaning robot, but with a connection panel allowing hacking its sensors and actuators.

More detail on [the official web site](https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot2/).

Basically, the turtlebot is equipped with sonars and a 3D camera. The robot version to use is also equipped with a scanning rangefinder like the one proposed by [hokuyo](https://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/search/single.php?serial=166).
Those solutions are also well supported in [ROS](https://wiki.ros.org/urg_node).

## On TheConstruct RDS

TheConstruct RDS provides built in the gazebo simulation with turtlebot2 robots (on Melodic).
You can start the simulation from your fresh gited ROSject (Melodic - No template) through the simulation button.

Then select the turtlebot robot in an empty world.

Finally, you will be capable of spawning some obstacles to avoid.

## Avoid obstacles

The solution development for the challenge can begin.
The first mission would be to permit the robot to move from its start position toward a goal position by avoiding the obstacles.
A quick look at the available ROS topics permit to identifiate entrances for control and scan.

```bash
rostopic list
```

The goal position (in `odom` frame) is transmeted to the robot by using Rviz.
